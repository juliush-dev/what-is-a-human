As I examine the concept of a broken heart from my own emotionally detached standpoint, I'm intrigued by the notion of this seemingly intangible pain. What does it mean to experience this emotional turmoil, I wonder?

A banana is an edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several
kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.

In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called "plantains",
distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size,
color, and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft
flesh rich in starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow,
red, purple, or brown when ripe.
