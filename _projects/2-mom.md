Developed collaboratively with a colleague, the Modules Manager is a web-based tool that efficiently manages modules. It provides students with a well-structured table, enabling them to quickly find the starting dates of each module in their curriculum. It simplifies the process of building and publishing a comprehensive module schedule.
